# Bird-Species-Audio-Identification-Ensembling-and-1D-2D-Signals
There are about 10,000 different bird species in the world, and they play an important role in the natural world. They serve as good indicators of declining habitat quality and pollution. It is often easier to hear birds than it is to see them. Bird_CLEF 2021 - Birdcall Identification is a Kaggle competition organized by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology whose challenge is to identify which birds are calling in long recordings, given training data generated in meaningfully different contexts. This paper is structured in a way that it first gives details of the competition and the given data so that there is a clear understanding of the challenges posed by the train and test data. Also, we provide a detailed solution to the approaches we used for this challenge including data preparation, augmentations, model building, training procedure, and post-processing techniques.
